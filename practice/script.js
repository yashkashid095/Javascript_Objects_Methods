//variables in js

var x = 10;
let y = 20;
const z = 30;//it has tp be intialized at the time of it is declared.

// `x` can be redeclared and reassigned.
x = 15;

// `y` can be reassigned but not redeclared.
y = 25;

// `z` cannot be reassigned or redeclared
// z = 35; // This will cause an error


// z=90 we will get an error like invalid assignment to const.
